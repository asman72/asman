# Working notes

- Describe how services communicate, not just their APIs.

- Make idempotency rules explicit for each operation.

- Clarify read vs write paths in early diagrams.

- Keep background jobs and user flows separated.

- Document failure modes next to each dependency.

- Highlight which parts can be eventually consistent.

- Capture assumptions and constraints in the same doc.

- Keep diagrams up to date with real behavior.

- Start documenting from the core data model.

- Make idempotency rules explicit for each operation.

- Clarify read vs write paths in early diagrams.

- Keep background jobs and user flows separated.

- Prefer simple queues over complex orchestration.

- Capture assumptions and constraints in the same doc.
